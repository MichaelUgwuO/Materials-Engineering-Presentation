# Materials Engineering Project: Wrist Pin Selection Presentation

## Project Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive report for the Materials Engineering course, focusing on the selection of an optimal material for a wrist pin used in internal combustion engines. The wrist pin plays a critical role by connecting the piston to the connecting rod and bearing the pivot as the piston moves.

## Course Details

- **Subject:** Materials Engineering
- **Year of Completion:** 2nd Year

## Contents

- **Introduction:** A brief overview of the wrist pin's role and importance in internal combustion engines.
- **Material Selection:** Detailed analysis of the chosen case hardening steel (DIN 17Cr3), including its suitability for high wear resistance and ability to withstand repetitive impact loads.
- **Chemical Composition and Processing:** Presents the chemical makeup of the selected steel and the series of processing steps necessary to achieve the desired material properties.
- **Dimension and Production Requirements:** Information on the specified dimensions for the wrist pin and the considerations for large-scale production.

## Purpose

The report serves as an academic exercise in materials selection, conducted as part of the second-year curriculum for the Materials Engineering course. It provides a detailed rationale for the choice of DIN 17Cr3 steel, examining its physical and chemical properties, and outlining the manufacturing process to meet the specified engineering requirements.
